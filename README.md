# Waste-Detection

The **Waste Detection System** is an AI-powered application that classifies waste as **degradable or non-degradable** using Machine Learning and Python. The system is trained on a dataset containing various types of waste materials, enabling it to accurately distinguish between biodegradable and non-biodegradable items. It utilizes **computer vision techniques** and **AI models** to analyze waste images, extracting key features for classification. By leveraging deep learning frameworks such as **TensorFlow or PyTorch**, the model efficiently processes and categorizes waste, aiding in proper waste management and recycling efforts. This system can be integrated into **smart waste disposal systems, environmental monitoring, and waste segregation units** to promote sustainability. Its implementation helps reduce environmental pollution by automating waste sorting, making waste management more efficient and eco-friendly.
